# siyirduino

Developed in pure C based on SDL library and released specifically for the ISOTDAQ-2011 school, the open-source game reads output values of an ACCELEROMETER on a GADGET SHIELD via an ARDUiNO I/O board to control a dodger. Source CODEs for the application and the FIRMWARE for the ARDUiNO I/O board together with the related LECTUREs are both available in this repository.
